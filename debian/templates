_Description: On what TCP port should BitlBee listen for connections?
 BitlBee normally listens on the regular IRC port, 6667. This might not be
 a very good idea when you're running a real IRC daemon as well. 6668 might
 be a good alternative. Leaving this value blank means that BitlBee will not
 be run automatically.
