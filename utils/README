This directory contains tiny additional programs which you might just like
or need to run BitlBee:


* bitlbeed.c

If you want to run BitlBee on a machine you don't have root access to, this
utility will help you. Compiling it is easy: 'gcc bitlbeed.c -o bitlbeed',
you don't need any special flags. Use 'bitlbeed -h' to get more help.

For example, 'bitlbeed -p6669 -n1 /home/wilmer/bin/bitlbee' will start
listening on TCP port 6669 (on any interface, you might not want that!)
and connect the specified BitlBee program to this socket as soon as
someone connects. The -n1 makes sure only one person can be connected
at once.

Of course this program can be used for other programs too, not just BitlBee.


* create_nicksfile.pl (Christian Friedl <christian.friedl@chello.at>)

This program reads your ~/.licq/ configuration data and convert it to a
correct .nicks file. This program can be extended to read other contact
list file formats as well.


* centericq2bitlbee.sh (geno <geno@xenyon.com>)

Converter script for CenterICQ ICQ contact lists. See the documentation
for more information.


* convert_gnomeicu.txt

Not a program, but this one contains a regex which should correctly
convert GnomeICU configuration files into the BitlBee format.


* Dynamic MOTD for BitlBee (Geert Hauwaerts <geert@hauwaerts.be>)

Originally, I wanted to put this program here, but Geert put it online
on his own server, with docs and stuff, so I guess it's better to put
a link here. dmotd is a little script which generates a motd with some
nice statistics, especially nice for servers with many people on it.

See http://dmotd.hauwaerts.be/ for more information.


* BitlBee-specific Irssi scripts for: tab completion, typing notifica-
tions, auto-away and more, by Tijmen Ruizendaal <tijmen.ruizendaal@gmail.com>.

There are too many scripts to include them all with BitlBee (and keep
them up-to-date), so you should get them from Tijmen's site:

Please do send your sources if you write anything useful for the Bee!
