TODO for BitlBee:

We're trying to keep a better TODO list now. The priorities here are somewhat
random, maybe. Or at least they change from time to time. The "After 1.0"
changes are very low-priority, the "Before 1.0" are "highest" priority, the
others are changes we'll do when we feel like doing them. They're usually not
as critical as the "Before 1.0" changes, but still a bit more important than
"After 1.0".

KNOWN BUGS TO FIX BEFORE 1.0:
- 100% cpu usage bugs.
  -> They're still there... :-(
- Check if the IRC send flood protection is reliable now.
  -> Probably not, at least it still causes troubles on logging in for some
     people. Maybe the thresholds aren't okay yet. Logins are just floody,
     nothing we can do about that.

Some time: (mainly features)
- Rewrite Jabber module - the current one sucks.
- Test Yahoo! groupchats a bit better, because they still seem to be a bit
  flakey.
  -> There are bug reports from time to time, but we can't do much about
     them, possibly it's more a libyahoo2 problem.
- Groupchats
  -> Make them work on other nets than MSN/Yahoo as well.
- Make usernames case-insensitive. (On case-insensitive filesystems this
  change isn't necessary. This one is going to suck with backward-compati-
  bilty...)
  -> We'll probably combine this with the introduction of a better file
     format for userdata.
- Remind the user of unanswered questions after some time.
- Maybe a way to send global messages. (for server shutdowns, for example)
- Away-auto-replies.
- Allow nick changes.

After 1.0: (mainly toys)
- File transfers -> DCC
- SSL support? Persistent connections? Things you can do with a bouncer/proxy.
- Support for buddy groups.
- What else?
