Instructions for building the Bitlbee Win32 port
================================================

1. Download the latest version using bzr (http://www.bazaar-ng.org/):
   bzr branch http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/oss/bitlbee/bzr/win32 bitlbee-win32
2. Download and install the required development files: 
    from http://www.ethereal.com/distribution/win32/development/:
    - libiconv
    - glib
    - glib-dev
    from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/
    - nss
    - nspr

I've put them inside c:\dev, so you might have the most with that location.

3. Open bitlbee.dsw in VC++ and build :-)

4. Now you're done. When running, make sure all the required DLL's are accessible. If they can't be found, place them inside c:\winnt\system32 or the Debug or Release directories inside bitlbee-...\win32\.

5. To build setup files, compile the bitlbee.iss file using the Inno Setup 
   program (available from www.jrsoftware.org).
