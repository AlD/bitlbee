Hello,

This plugin allows you to add Skype support to BitlBee. It's mainly written by
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@frugalware.org>.

How to set it up:

- You need the BitlBee bzr branch:

bzr branch http://code.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/

- You need to enable plugin support:

http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/bitlbee-configure-plugins.patch

- To be able to do an install-dev:

http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/bitlbee-makefile-headers.patch

- Now compile and install it:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install install-dev

- Get the plugin code:

git clone http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/bitlbee-skype

- Compile and install it:

make
cp skype.so /usr/lib/bitlbee

- Set up the tcp server:

FIXME

What works:

- Download nicks and away statuses from Skype

- Sending messages

- Receiving messages

What needs to be done (aka. TODO):

- import the daemon code

- convert this readme to asciidoc

- we can't ourselves join to &bitlbee (ignore such a message from skype)

- mark received messages as read so that skype won't say there are unread messages

- Away status changes (send / receive)

- join / parts

- add/remove users, detect when somebody wants to add us (maybe detect when we're removed?)

- maybe on account on/off, change our state from/to offline? so that we won't miss any message

- handle the case when the tcp server is not running (currently SIGPIPE is not handled at all by the plugin)

If something does not work and it's not in the TODO section, then please contact me!
