What works:

- Download nicks and away statuses from Skype

- Sending messages

- Receiving messages

What needs to be done:

- mark received messages as read so that skype won't say there are unread messages

- Away status changes (send / receive)

- join / parts

- add/remove users, detect when somebody wants to add us (maybe detect when we're removed?)

- maybe on account on/off, change our state from/to offline? so that we won't miss any message
