Hello,

This plugin allows you to add Skype support to BitlBee. It's mainly written by
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@frugalware.org>.

How to set it up:

- You need the BitlBee bzr branch:

bzr branch http://code.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/

- You need to enable plugin support:

http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/bitlbee-configure-plugins.patch

- To be able to do an install-dev:

http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/bitlbee-makefile-headers.patch

- Now compile and install it:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install install-dev

- Get the plugin code:

git clone http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/bitlbee-skype

- Compile and install it:

make
cp skype.so /usr/lib/bitlbee

- Start skyped (the tcp server):

python skyped.py

NOTE: It's important to start skyped on the same machine and using the same
user as you run Skype as it uses the session DBus for communication!

What works:

- Download nicks and away statuses from Skype

- Sending messages

- Receiving messages

- skyped (the tcp daemon that is a gateway between Skype and tcp)

- Error handling when skyped is not running and when it exists

What needs to be done (aka. TODO):

- convert this readme to asciidoc

- we can't ourselves join to &bitlbee (ignore such a message from skype)

- mark received messages as read so that skype won't say there are unread messages

- Away status changes (send / receive)

- join / parts

- add/remove users, detect when somebody wants to add us (maybe detect when we're removed?)

- maybe on account on/off, change our state from/to offline? so that we won't miss any message

If something does not work and it's not in the TODO section, then please contact me!
