= Skype plugin for BitlBee
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@frugalware.org>

== How to set it up

- You need the BitlBee bzr branch:

----
bzr branch http://code.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/
----

- You need to enable plugin support:

----
http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/bitlbee-configure-plugins.patch
----

- To be able to do an install-dev:

----
http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/bitlbee-makefile-headers.patch
----

- Now compile and install it:

----
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install install-dev
----

- Get the plugin code:

----
git clone http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/bitlbee-skype
----

- Compile and install it:

----
make
cp skype.so /usr/lib/bitlbee
----

- Start skyped (the tcp server):

----
python skyped.py
----

NOTE: It's important to start skyped on the same machine and using the same
user as you run Skype as it uses the session DBus for communication!

- Start your IRC client, connect to BitlBee and add your account:

----
account add skype <user> <pass>
account set 0/server localhost
----

IMPORTANT: <user> should be your skype account name. This way you won't see
yourself joining to `&bitlbee`.

NOTE: the <pass> option is not used currently.

== What works

- Download nicks and away statuses from Skype

- Sending messages

- Receiving messages

- skyped (the tcp daemon that is a gateway between Skype and tcp)

- Error handling when skyped is not running and when it exists

== What needs to be done (aka. TODO)

- we can't ourselves join to &bitlbee (ignore such a message from skype)

- mark received messages as read so that skype won't say there are unread messages

- Away status changes (send / receive)

- join / parts

- add/remove users, detect when somebody wants to add us (maybe detect when we're removed?)

- maybe on account on/off, change our state from/to offline? so that we won't miss any message

== I would like to have support for ...

If something does not work and it's not in the TODO section, then please contact me!
