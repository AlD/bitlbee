                when there is no traffic for a long time
              - now the plugin or skyped is automatically disabled if

                reporting address)
0.5.0         - skyped now uses gnutls if possible, which seem to be

              - skyped now tries to handle all read/write errors from/to
                clients, and always just warn about failures, never exit.

              - improved documentation

	      - support for receiving emoted messages, ie. when the user types
	        '/me foo'
